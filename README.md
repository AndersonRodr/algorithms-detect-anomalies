# Study about algorithms for detect anomalies in weather data

This project is for study some algorithms that detect anomalies (outliers) and to determinate only the one best.
Algorithms for test:
- DBSCAN;
- IF (Isolation Forest);
- Topological Data Analisys (Bonus).

We will use data by API INMET.
